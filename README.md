This original library that was introduced in [CodePlex](http://universalanalytics.codeplex.com). The library was for .NET Framework web application to render **analytics.js** javascript client-side to interact with Google API from .NET language web application within the server-side code environment. Both ASP.NET WebForm and ASP.NET MVC. Its was good, but we would like to see a much more extensible and ambust platform, so we are rewriting the entire framework.
